Hate Speech Detection

Project Overview This project focuses on detecting hate speech in text data using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify text into categories such as hate speech, offensive language, or neutral speech.

Features Preprocessing of text data (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, etc.) Feature extraction using techniques such as TF-IDF or word embeddings Model training using machine learning algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, or deep learning models) Evaluation using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score Web-based user interface for inputting text and receiving predictions

Installation# Hate-Speech-Detection 1.Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/hate-speech-detection.git cd hate-speech-detection 2.Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt 3,Run the application: python app.py

Dataset The dataset used for training is sourced from publicly available hate speech datasets. You can find similar datasets on Kaggle or other open sources.

Usage Run the web application and input text to check for hate speech. Use the trained model to classify large datasets of text messages. Fine-tune the model with custom datasets for better performance.

Technologies Used Python Flask (for web app) Scikit-learn / TensorFlow (for ML models) NLTK / SpaCy (for NLP preprocessing)
